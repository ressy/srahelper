# This is a submission template for batch deposit SRA metadata													
#All fields are mendatory													
"#You can add as many files to a sample you wish by adding more columns with headers filename2, filename3,etc"													
"#File names in the metadata must match the files that are upload, if you are uploading a tar file and you have directories, please specify the directory as part of the file name"													
"#You can also add custom attributes to your data by adding more columns, the attributes will part of the Run"													
"# CAUTION: Be aware that Excel may automatically apply formatting to your data. In particular, take care with dates(it is best to format date fields as text), incrementing autofills and special characters like / or -. Doublecheck that your text file is accurate before uploading to SRA."													
# TO MAKE A SUBMISSION:													
"#     1. Complete the template table (typically in Excel, or another spreadsheet application)"													
"#     2. Save the worksheet as a Text (Tab-delimited) file - use 'File, Save as, Save as type: Text (Tab-delimited)'"													
#     3. Upload the file on the SRA metadata tab of the SRA Submission Portal at https://submit.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/subs/sra/.													
"#     4. If you have any questions, please contact us at sra@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov."
